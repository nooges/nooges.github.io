I'm currently a software engineer at [Freedom](https://freedom.to), where I mainly develop applications for OS X, iOS, and Windows.

My background is in electrical engineering, with a focus on digital signal processing, control systems, and communication systems.
I used to work as a communication systems engineer for about 10 years, researching, creating, and implementing algorithms for processing wireless signals on software-defined radio (SDR) systems.

I've been programming back since middle school, where I first got started with a TI-82, doing Basic and Z80 assembly. I've spent a lot of time doing Python and C++, with some other languages along the way, like Fortran and MATLAB (ugh). These days, I do most of my development in Swift, Objective-C, C#, and Python. On the side, I've been playing around with Elixir and Ruby.
